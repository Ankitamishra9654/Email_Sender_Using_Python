# Email_Sender_Using_Python


This mini project demonstrates how to send an email using Python's `smtplib` and `email` libraries. The script takes user input for the recipient's email address, subject, and message, then sends the email using Gmail's SMTP server.

## Features

- User inputs recipient email, subject, and message.
- Sends email using Gmail's SMTP server with SSL.
- Handles authentication errors and other SMTP exceptions gracefully.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Gmail account with App Password enabled (for accounts with 2-step verification)

## Important Notes

- Make sure to use an App Password for Gmail if 2-step verification is enabled on your account.
- Keep your credentials secure and do not share them publicly.
